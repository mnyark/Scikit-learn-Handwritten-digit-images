Exploring Handwritten Digit Images

This project was developed in the Jupyter notebook environment. You may need to use the Jupyter Notebook notebook environment or a similar virtual environment in order to visualize all the plotted data. Especially the 3D plot. 

Dependencies:

1. Python3
2. Matplotlib libraries: pyplot
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit Learn libraries: datasets, cross_validation, naive_bayes, metrics, svm, decomposition, pipeline, grid_search, ensemble
6. Scipy

3D plot:
7. mpl_toolkits
8. __future__
9. ipywidgets
10. Scikit learn datasets.samples_generator

Module imports:
1. load_digits from datasets
2. plt from pyplot
3. train_test_split from cross_validation
4. GaussianNB from naive_bayes
5. accuracy_score from metrics
6. sns from Seabon
7. confusion_matrix from metrics
8. stats from scipy
9. mplot3d from mpl_toolkits
10. print_function from __future__
11. interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual from ipywidgets
12. make_circles from datasets.samples_generator
13. SVC from svm
14. PCA from decomposition
15. make_pipeline from pipeline
16. GridSearchCV from grid_search
17. RandomForestClassifier from ensemble

When all these Dependency requirements have been met, you can run the code in your favorite virtual environment, preferably jupyter notebook as stated earlier. 
The dataset for this project is inbuilt with the Scikit learn library. The code already generates the dataset after it has been imported and you will not need to handle that.
