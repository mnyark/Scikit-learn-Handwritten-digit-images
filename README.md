# Exploring Handwritten Digit Images

This project was developed in the Jupyter notebook environment. You may need to use the Jupyter Notebook notebook environment or a similar virtual environment in order to visualize all the plotted data. Especially the 3D plot. 


When all the requirements have been met `Check requirements.txt`, you can run the code in your favorite virtual environment, preferably jupyter notebook as stated earlier. 
The dataset for this project is inbuilt with the Scikit learn library. The code already generates the dataset after it has been imported and you will not need to handle that. Enjoy!
